# HW1 - Jesse Chen 9/4/2022

### Split
split.cpp contains a void split function that recursively
separates a linked list into two linked lists
that contain odd and even numbers
` g++ -g -Wall split.cpp split_test.cpp -o split`

### Ulliststr
ulliststr.cpp contains functions that allow adding and removing
elements to the front and back of an unrolled linked list, as well
as viewing the first and last element and getting a specific
index element in the list.

To run the homework, please run
` g++ -g -Wall ulliststr.cpp ulliststr_test.cpp -o ulliststr_test `
